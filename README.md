## MDPrognosys ü©∫

Project Name: "MDPrognosys"

Description:
MDPrognosys" was a Ph.D. endeavor, developed using Meta 2, an augmented reality device. The primary objective was to create an immersive scenario where doctors could explore 3D models generated from tomographies to gain valuable insights into the patient's anatomy before any physical procedures.

Through the innovative use of Meta 2's augmented reality capabilities, the project aimed to revolutionize medical practices by providing physicians with a comprehensive understanding of the patient's anatomy. By visualizing 3D models derived from tomography scans, doctors could explore intricate details of the patient's anatomy in a realistic and interactive manner.

The significance of "MDPrognosys" extended beyond its technological prowess; it showcased the potential of augmented reality to enhance medical diagnosis and treatment planning. By offering doctors a unique and interactive way to examine the patient's body non-invasively, the project aimed to optimize medical procedures, improve patient outcomes, and drive advancements in the field of healthcare.

## WEBGL Rendering

Project Name: "WEBGL loading models"

Description: This was a delightful little project where I set out to render multiple objects in WebGL and, as an added bonus, incorporated some basic camera movement.

In this endeavor, I dived into the world of WebGL, eager to explore its possibilities. Although the project might seem simple in scope, it quickly became a playground of creativity and technical ingenuity.

## Pathfinding algorithm

Project Name: "AI Pathfinding"

Description:During my time at university, while taking AI classes, I had the opportunity to develop a pathfinding algorithm using Processing.py.

The pathfinding algorithm I crafted aimed to find the most efficient path between two points on a grid, simulating real-world navigation scenarios. I poured my heart into fine-tuning the algorithm's logic and optimizing its performance, ensuring that it would produce accurate and swift results.
